# Obsidian Pets

This is an Obsidian plugin that brings the joy of `vscode-pets` to your vault. It adds a cute pet to your Obsidian workspace that follows you around.

This project is a direct translation of the popular Visual Studio Code extension [vscode-pets](https://github.com/tonybaloney/vscode-pets) by [Anthony Shaw](https://github.com/tonybaloney).

## How to Use

1.  Install the plugin from the Obsidian community plugins browser.
2.  Enable the plugin in your Obsidian settings.
3.  Open the command palette and run the command "Open Pet View".
4.  A new view will open in the right sidebar with your new pet!

You can customize the pet type, color, size, and background theme from the plugin's settings tab.
